            <h2>Hello!</h2>
            <p>Hello, I'm Jasmine Castro, a senior at the University of Illinois at Chicago majoring in Computer Science. 
               Over the past few years, I've gained invaluable experience as a software engineer through two impactful internship opportunities, 
               one at Peak6 and the other at Medtronic. These experiences have equipped me with hands-on knowledge in software development, problem-solving, 
               and collaborative teamwork. As a computer science enthusiast, I'm particularly passionate about applying cutting-edge technology to solve real-world challenges. 
               I'm actively seeking opportunities to contribute my skills and make a positive impact in a dynamic tech environment. </p>
